# sway-dotfiles

I tried my best to organize and modularize this sway setup, without making it so rigid that it would be impossible for other people to use it as a reference and just change a few things. Enjoy and customize it to your personal taste.

To use the wallpaper selector, you need to place your wallpapers in the directory `~/Pictures/Wallpapers` (folders with images is ok too). Once you have your images in the correct folder, you can access the wallpaper selector by pressing `Super + T`. This will open the Rofi menu, allowing you to choose from your available wallpapers or select a random one to set as your background.
